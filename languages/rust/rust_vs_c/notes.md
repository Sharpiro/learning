# refs and pointers

- cpp refs can't be reassigned, rust's can if set to mutable
- in cpp, refs are basically just aliases, likely just hiding pointer implementations
- in rust, refs are first-class and get passed by value
- i like rust's better b/c it's more clear and explicit
- cpp uses references as safer pointers, passed by reference
- rust uses references as safer pointers, passed by value
- cpp terribly deep-copies vectors by default
